# ArdunioRoboticCar_AIWithRemote
This is the Arduino Uno R3 code that I created that utilizes the Q-Learning algorithm to navigate any maze.  

I built the robotic car with the following hardware:
Arduino Uno Rev 3

Parallax Ping (28015) – Distance sensor

Adafruit Motor Sheild Rev. 2.3 (I needed to solder pins which was very difficult)

Vilros Micro Servo 99 (SG90) – Spins the sensor in different directions

Multi-colored LED light – used to signal when training is completess

8 AA batteries to power motor shield

1 9V battery to power Arduino

Infrared receiver – to receive signal from remote control

Remote control - any remote control will do

4 wheel robotic smart car chasis


It uses the Q-Learning algorithm to learn the algorithm the best option.
